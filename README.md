# API reference

The FoxTrip API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
