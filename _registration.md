# Registration a new user (3)

Any host who was authorized can be registered in the system. Registered users get possobility to recive nottifications about news, offers and new routes. 

The host must send registration request with his data encrypted by session key. The session key is called array of bytes which has 32 length encripted by Base64. This key is used by AES algorightm with CBC mode. 

The user must also fill *WWW-Authenticate* header by the indentificator which the server has gave for temprorary using.
````
POST /api/v1/request?t=3 HTTP/1.1
WWW-Authenticate: mpxBYOaI/rOmgyk
````
The user has to fill the body of the request by array of bytes which he got as a result of encryption by session key. Example of the JSON data which the server has to get is bellow:
```` json
{
    "email"     : "alisa@email.com",
    "password"  : "mpxBYOaI/rOmgyk/0Z6eT3mqSrToHibo9Amxsnaun+E=",
    "name"      : "Alisa",
    "surname"   : "Fox"
}
````

A client has to send hash of password which was generated by SHA-256. This password will be written to master database and all data about user as well. If registration was successfull the user gets role **Guest** and server will return response **200 Ok** with body which will contain *id* of just created user. 

The client become authenticated and it is not neccary to pass procedure of [authetentification]()

```` json
{
    "id": "3"
}
````
Another way the server will return one of the error statuses.
