# Gettings routes (31)
Any user may requests routes. The HTTP request has to contain header *Content-Language* which defines languege (BCP47) of content which reqiers. If there is no selected languege then the server will return the **404 Not Found** status.

```
GET /api/v1/request?t=31&page=<page>&limit=<limit>&filter=<filter> HTTP/1.1
Access-Token: 4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc
Content-Language: cs-CZ
```
where:

* `<page>` - is used to specify offset of a route collection. *This argument is requierd* 
* `<limit>` - is used to specify the maximum number of routes of a collection to return in a response. *This argument is requierd* 
* `<filter>` - defines filter for searching

### Searching filter
This request supports filter for searching. The filter query parameter is used to filter items in a collection to return a subset of routes in a response.

The filter parameter accepts the array data type. To filter a collection use the filter query parameter in the following format:

````
GET /api/v1/request?t=31&filter=[{"property":"<property>","operator":"<operator>","value":"<value>"}]
````
where:
* `<property>` is the resource property name.
* `<operator>` is the compare operator.
* `<value>` is the value of the property.

The request supports also complex filter, such as filtering by several properties combined logical operations:
````
GET api/v1/request?t=31&filter=[{"operator"="<operator>","items":<items>]
```` 
where:
* `<items>` is a collection of properties. All properies inside the collection will be combined with `<operator>` which is defined in root.

The server supports the following operators:

| Operator                | Description                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **eq** (==)             | Returns routes that match the specified property value.                                                    |
| **ne** (!=)             | Returns routes that do not match the specified property value.                                             |
| **gt** (>)              | Returns routes with the property value that is greater than the specified value.                           |
| **lt** (<)              | Returns routes with the property value that is less than the specified value.                              |
| **loe** (<=)            | Returns routes with the property value that is less or equal than the specified value.                     |
| **goe** (>=)            | Returns routes with the property value that is less or equal than the specified value.                     |
| **and** (logical AND)   | Returns routes that match all the specified property values.                                               |
| **or** (logical OR)     | Returns routes that match at least one of the specified property values.                                   |
| **like**                | Returns routes that match a specified pattern in the property value. Apply only for *string* properties    |

The server supports the following properties:

| Property      | Type      | Description                                       |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **title**     | String    | Defines title of the route.                       |

| **tag_id**    | Integer   | Defines indentificator of a tag for the route.    |
| **place_id**  | Integer   | Defines indentificator of a place for the route.  |
| **public**    | Boolean   | Defines visibility of the route for users.

If reqeust contains this field the filter will be applied if the user is authorized and have permissions, another way it will return `401 Unauthorized` |

### Examples
* To get a representation of a route with the specified distance, send the following request:
````
GET http://127.0.0.1:9898/api/v1/request?t=31&page=1&limit=15&filter=[{"property":"distance","operator":"goe","value":"1150"}]
````

* To return a list of routes with the range of distances, send the following request:
````
GET http://127.0.0.1:9898/api/v1/request?t=31&page=1&limit=15&filter=[{"operator":"and", "items":[{"property":"distance","operator":"goe","value":"1150"}, "property":"distance","operator":"loe","value":"4500"]}]
````
